# Analysis of Single-Cell and Bulk RNA-seq Data by R
Rewriting the code of a paper about employing scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq for research on breast cancer. 
<br> This project has been done mainly by means of the Seurat package (version 3) in R.</br>
<br> The main challenge of this project was to rewrite the code without knowing the value of parameters that have been set in various functions. As a result, I had to run a function several times to find the best value for a parameter.
